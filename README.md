## Telco Team Project

## Purpose
Why are our customers churning?

Some questions I have include:

1. Are there clear groupings where a customer is more likely to churn? 
    - What if you consider contract type? 
    - Is there a tenure that month-to-month customers are most likely to churn?
    - 1-year contract customers? 2-year customers?
    - Do you have any thoughts on what could be going on? (Be sure to state these thoughts not as facts but as untested hypotheses. Unless you test them!).
    - Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total customers).
2. Are there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? 
    - like type of internet service,
    - type of phone service,
    - online security and backup,
    - senior citizens,
    - paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?
3. Is there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point?
    - If so, what is that point for what service(s)?
4. If we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?
